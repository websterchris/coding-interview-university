## The Daily Plan

Some subjects take one day, and some will take multiple days. Some are just learning with nothing to implement.

Each day  take one subject from the list below, watch videos about that subject, and write an implementation in:
- C - using structs and functions that take a struct * and something else as args.
- C++ - without using built-in types
- C++ - using built-in types, like STL's std::list for a linked list
- Python - using built-in types (to keep practicing Python)
- and write tests to ensure I'm doing it right, sometimes just using simple assert() statements
- You may do Java or something else, this is just my thing.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

- [ ] **Learn C**
    - C is everywhere. You'll see examples in books, lectures, videos, *everywhere* while you're studying.
    - [ ] [C Programming Language, Vol 2](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628)
        - This is a short book, but it will give you a great handle on the C language and if you practice it a little
            you'll quickly get proficient. Understanding C helps you understand how programs and memory work.

## Data Structures

- ### Arrays
    - Implement an automatically resizing vector.
    - [ ] Description:

        - [Resizing arrays (video)](https://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Resizable-arrays/149042/177108-4.html)
    - [ ] Implement a vector (mutable array with automatic resizing):
        - [ ] Practice coding using arrays and pointers, and pointer math to jump to an index instead of using indexing.
        - [ ] new raw data array with allocated memory
            - can allocate int array under the hood, just not use its features
            - start with 16, or if starting number is greater, use power of 2 - 16, 32, 64, 128
        - [ ] size() - number of items
        - [ ] capacity() - number of items it can hold
        - [ ] is_empty()
        - [ ] at(index) - returns item at given index, blows up if index out of bounds
        - [ ] push(item)
        - [ ] insert(index, item) - inserts item at index, shifts that index's value and trailing elements to the right
        - [ ] prepend(item) - can use insert above at index 0
        - [ ] pop() - remove from end, return value
        - [ ] delete(index) - delete item at index, shifting all trailing elements left
        - [ ] remove(item) - looks for value and removes index holding it (even if in multiple places)
        - [ ] find(item) - looks for value and returns first index with that value, -1 if not found
        - [ ] resize(new_capacity) // private function
            - when you reach capacity, resize to double the size
            - when popping an item, if size is 1/4 of capacity, resize to half
    - [ ] Time
        - O(1) to add/remove at end (amortized for allocations for more space), index, or update
        - O(n) to insert/remove elsewhere
    - [ ] Space
        - contiguous in memory, so proximity helps performance
        - space needed = (array capacity, which is >= n) * size of item, but even if 2n, still O(n)

- ### Linked Lists
    - [ ] Description:
        - [ ] [Singly Linked Lists (video)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/kHhgK/singly-linked-lists)
        - [ ] [CS 61B - Linked Lists 1 (video)](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_htzJdKoEmO0)
        - [ ] [CS 61B - Linked Lists 2 (video)](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_-c4I3gFYe3w)
    - [ ] [C Code (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN6FPiD0Gzo)
            - not the whole video, just portions about Node struct and memory allocation.
    - [ ] Linked List vs Arrays:
        - [Core Linked Lists Vs Arrays (video)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance/lecture/rjBs9/core-linked-lists-vs-arrays)
        - [In The Real World Linked Lists Vs Arrays (video)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance/lecture/QUaUd/in-the-real-world-lists-vs-arrays)
    - [ ] [why you should avoid linked lists (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQs6IC-vgmo)
    - [ ] Gotcha: you need pointer to pointer knowledge:
        (for when you pass a pointer to a function that may change the address where that pointer points)
        This page is just to get a grasp on ptr to ptr. I don't recommend this list traversal style. Readability and maintainability suffer due to cleverness.
        - [Pointers to Pointers](https://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/int/sx8.html)
    - [ ] implement (I did with tail pointer & without):
        - [ ] size() - returns number of data elements in list
        - [ ] empty() - bool returns true if empty
        - [ ] value_at(index) - returns the value of the nth item (starting at 0 for first)
        - [ ] push_front(value) - adds an item to the front of the list
        - [ ] pop_front() - remove front item and return its value
        - [ ] push_back(value) - adds an item at the end
        - [ ] pop_back() - removes end item and returns its value
        - [ ] front() - get value of front item
        - [ ] back() - get value of end item
        - [ ] insert(index, value) - insert value at index, so current item at that index is pointed to by new item at index
        - [ ] erase(index) - removes node at given index
        - [ ] value_n_from_end(n) - returns the value of the node at nth position from the end of the list
        - [ ] reverse() - reverses the list
        - [ ] remove_value(value) - removes the first item in the list with this value
    - [ ] Doubly-linked List
        - [Description (video)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/jpGKD/doubly-linked-lists)
        - No need to implement

- ### Stack
    - [ ] [Stacks (video)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/UdKzQ/stacks)
    - [ ] [Using Stacks Last-In First-Out (video)](https://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Using-stacks-last-first-out/149042/177120-4.html)
    - [ ] Will not implement. Implementing with array is trivial.

- ### Queue
    - [ ] [Using Queues First-In First-Out(video)](https://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Using-queues-first-first-out/149042/177122-4.html)
    - [ ] [Queue (video)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/EShpq/queue)
    - [ ] [Circular buffer/FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer)
    - [ ] [Priority Queues (video)](https://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Priority-queues-deques/149042/177123-4.html)
    - [ ] Implement using linked-list, with tail pointer:
        - enqueue(value) - adds value at position at tail
        - dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element (front)
        - empty()
    - [ ] Implement using fixed-sized array:
        - enqueue(value) - adds item at end of available storage
        - dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element
        - empty()
        - full()
    - [ ] Cost:
        - a bad implementation using linked list where you enqueue at head and dequeue at tail would be O(n)
            because you'd need the next to last element, causing a full traversal each dequeue
        - enqueue: O(1) (amortized, linked list and array [probing])
        - dequeue: O(1) (linked list and array)
        - empty: O(1) (linked list and array)

    - [ ] Implement a max-heap:
        - [ ] insert
        - [ ] sift_up - needed for insert
        - [ ] get_max - returns the max item, without removing it
        - [ ] get_size() - return number of elements stored
        - [ ] is_empty() - returns true if heap contains no elements
        - [ ] extract_max - returns the max item, removing it
        - [ ] sift_down - needed for extract_max
        - [ ] remove(i) - removes item at index x
        - [ ] heapify - create a heap from an array of elements, needed for heap_sort
        - [ ] heap_sort() - take an unsorted array and turn it into a sorted array in-place using a max heap
            - note: using a min heap instead would save operations, but double the space needed (cannot do in-place).

## Sorting

- [ ] Notes:
    - Implement sorts & know best case/worst case, average complexity of each:
        - no bubble sort - it's terrible - O(n^2), except when n <= 16

## Graphs

Graphs can be used to represent many problems in computer science, so this section is long, like trees and sorting were.

- Notes:
    - There are 4 basic ways to represent a graph in memory:
        - objects and pointers
        - adjacency matrix
        - adjacency list
        - adjacency map
    - Familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros & cons
    - BFS and DFS - know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs, and how to implement them in real code
    - When asked a question, look for a graph-based solution first, then move on if none.

        - Thread resource needs (shares above (minus stack) with other threads in the same process but each has its own pc, stack counter, registers, and stack)
        - Forking is really copy on write (read-only) until the new process writes to memory, then it does a full copy.

## System Design, Scalability, Data Handling
- **You can expect system design questions if you have 4+ years of experience.**
- Scalability and System Design are very large topics with many topics and resources, since
      there is a lot to consider when designing a software/hardware system that can scale.
      Expect to spend quite a bit of time on this.
- Considerations:
    - scalability
        - Distill large data sets to single values
        - Transform one data set to another
        - Handling obscenely large amounts of data
    - system design
        - features sets
        - interfaces
        - class hierarchies
        - designing a system under certain constraints
        - simplicity and robustness
        - tradeoffs

    - [cheat sheet](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university/blob/master/extras/cheat%20sheets/system-design.pdf)
    - flow:
        1. Understand the problem and scope:
            - define the use cases, with interviewer's help
            - suggest additional features
            - remove items that interviewer deems out of scope
            - assume high availability is required, add as a use case
        2. Think about constraints:
            - ask how many requests per month
            - ask how many requests per second (they may volunteer it or make you do the math)
            - estimate reads vs. writes percentage
            - keep 80/20 rule in mind when estimating
            - how much data written per second
            - total storage required over 5 years
            - how much data read per second
        3. Abstract design:
            - layers (service, data, caching)
            - infrastructure: load balancing, messaging
            - rough overview of any key algorithm that drives the service
            - consider bottlenecks and determine solutions

## Coding Question Practice

Now that you know all the computer science topics above, it's time to practice answering coding problems.

**Coding question practice is not about memorizing answers to programming problems.**

Why you need to practice doing programming problems:
- problem recognition, and where the right data structures and algorithms fit in
- gathering requirements for the problem
- talking your way through the problem like you will in the interview
- coding on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer
- coming up with time and space complexity for your solutions
- testing your solutions

There is a great intro for methodical, communicative problem solving in an interview. You'll get this from the programming
interview books, too, but I found this outstanding:
[Algorithm design canvas](http://www.hiredintech.com/algorithm-design/)

No whiteboard at home? That makes sense. I'm a weirdo and have a big whiteboard. Instead of a whiteboard, pick up a
large drawing pad from an art store. You can sit on the couch and practice. This is my "sofa whiteboard".
I added the pen in the photo for scale. If you use a pen, you'll wish you could erase. Gets messy quick.

## Coding exercises/challenges

Once you've learned your brains out, put those brains to work.
Take coding challenges every day, as many as you can.

- [Pramp: Mock interviews from/with peers](https://www.pramp.com/) - peer-to-peer model of practice interviews
- [Refdash: Mock interviews and expedited interviews](https://refdash.com/) - also help candidates fast track by skipping multiple interviews with tech companies.

## Your Resume

- See Resume prep items in Cracking The Coding Interview and back of Programming Interviews Exposed


## Be thinking of for when the interview comes

Think of about 20 interview questions you'll get, along with the lines of the items below. Have 2-3 answers for each.
Have a story, not just data, about something you accomplished.

- Why do you want this job?
- What's a tough problem you've solved?
- Biggest challenges faced?
- Best/worst designs seen?
- Ideas for improving an existing product.
- How do you work best, as an individual and as part of a team?
- Which of your skills or experiences would be assets in the role and why?
- What did you most enjoy at [job x / project y]?
- What was the biggest challenge you faced at [job x / project y]?
- What was the hardest bug you faced at [job x / project y]?
- What did you learn at [job x / project y]?
- What would you have done better at [job x / project y]?

## Have questions for the interviewer

    Some of mine (I already may know answer to but want their opinion or team perspective):

- How large is your team?
- What does your dev cycle look like? Do you do waterfall/sprints/agile?
- Are rushes to deadlines common? Or is there flexibility?
- How are decisions made in your team?
- How many meetings do you have per week?
- Do you feel your work environment helps you concentrate?
- What are you working on?
- What do you like about it?
- What is the work life like?

# Book List

## Interview Prep

- [ ] [Programming Interviews Exposed: Secrets to Landing Your Next Job, 2nd Edition](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047012167X.html)
    - answers in C++ and Java
    - this is a good warm-up for Cracking the Coding Interview
    - not too difficult, most problems may be easier than what you'll see in an interview (from what I've read)
- [ ] [Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850/)
    - answers in Java
- [ ] [Elements of Programming Interviews (C++ version)](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Insiders-Guide/dp/1479274836)
- [ ] Elements of Programming Interviews (Java version)
    - [book](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Java-Insiders/dp/1517435803/)
    - [Companion Project - Method Stub and Test Cases for Every Problem in the Book](https://github.com/gardncl/elements-of-programming-interviews)

## Computer Architecture
- [ ] [Write Great Code: Volume 1: Understanding the Machine](https://www.amazon.com/Write-Great-Code-Understanding-Machine/dp/1593270038)
    - The book was published in 2004, and is somewhat outdated, but it's a terrific resource for understanding a computer in brief.
    - The author invented HLA, so take mentions and examples in HLA with a grain of salt. Not widely used, but decent examples of what assembly looks like.
    - These chapters are worth the read to give you a nice foundation:
        - Chapter 2 - Numeric Representation
        - Chapter 3 - Binary Arithmetic and Bit Operations
        - Chapter 4 - Floating-Point Representation
        - Chapter 5 - Character Representation
        - Chapter 6 - Memory Organization and Access
        - Chapter 7 - Composite Data Types and Memory Objects
        - Chapter 9 - CPU Architecture
        - Chapter 10 - Instruction Set Architecture
        - Chapter 11 - Memory Architecture and Organization
- [ ] [Computer Architecture, Fifth Edition: A Quantitative Approach](https://www.amazon.com/dp/012383872X/)
    - For a richer, more up-to-date (2011), but longer treatment

## Java

- [ ] [Algorithms (Sedgewick and Wayne)](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X/)
